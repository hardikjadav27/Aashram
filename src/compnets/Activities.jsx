                    Sri Ram Ashram and Gaushala Trust, a charitable organization, is committed to caring for
                    Gaumate (cows) who are left alone or abandoned due to physical inability. Our mission is to
                    provide lifelong support to these cows, with safe shelter, food, and needed medical facilities.
                    We believe strongly that they should treat them with the respect they have an important role
                    in our life like our mothers. Currently, we are operating a gaushala in different locations of
                    Rajasthan where we ensure a nurturing environment, offering essential facilities for the well-being
                    of our Gaumates. Devoted to the noble cause of preserving these precious lives, our trust strives
                    to uphold the sacred tradition of revering cows.

                    Temples are the home to our Sanatan Dharm, and our trust is deeply rooted in its ideals. Our
                    core is a sacred temple where we engage in welfare activities to benefit society. With the
                    blessings of Lord Rama, we have undertaken the responsibility of constructing temples and till
                    date, we have constructed temples in various areas of Rajasthan. Temples have a significant role
                    in preserving India’s ancient culture, traditions, and heritage. With your support, we aim to be
                    engaged in constructing more temples, contributing to the promotion and sustenance of our rich
                    heritage.
